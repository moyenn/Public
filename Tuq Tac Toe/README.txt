Written w/ javascript, HTML, and CSS (with some tutorial help)!

I wanted to write an implementation using Roblox Studio and the Lua language, 
but it might be hard to run without making a Roblox account

If you don't want to run the program yourself, the two .mp4 files demonstrate the program (run on Visual Studio Code Live Server), 
otherwise you can access the files!

Enjoy! B)
